## [EloShapes.com](https://www.eloshapes.com/) &nbsp;<sub><sup>(Jan. 2022 - present)</sub></sup>
+ EloShapes is a website that lets users compare 500+ gaming products.
+ The development of EloShapes started in January 2022 when I only had a basic understanding of HTML and CSS from one of my courses at OsloMet. I used this website as a way to learn more about JavaScript and backend technologies such as Java (Spring Boot) and SQL. 
+ After some time, I eventually decided to improve and build this small passion project into a website that could be used by others. After my first year at university, I spent the entire summer learning and improving my skills in order to publish the website, and so I did.
+ EloShapes was launched on 22.08.2022, gaining more than 6500 within the first 24 hours.
It has since been used by 500,000+ people from all around the world and currently receives 240,000+ monthly visits. In total, EloShapes has been visited more than 2 million times since its launch.
+ I am currently working on re-creating EloShapes to improve its maintainability and optimize the website's functionality and performance in order to give users the best experience possible. The beta is available here: https://eloshapes.vercel.app/
