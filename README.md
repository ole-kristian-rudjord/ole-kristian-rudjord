EloShapes is a website for comparing over 700 gaming products that attract more than 200,000 visits from over 80,000 unique monthly users. Development started in January 2022, only having a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, serving as a platform for deepening my understanding of JavaScript, Java (Spring Boot), and MongoDB.

Motivated by a growing passion, I transformed this project into a user-centric website. Following my first year at university, I dedicated the entire summer to enhancing my skills, culminating in the launch on August 22, 2022, and receiving over 6,500 visits on its debut day.

Since its launch, EloShapes has undergone significant evolution, transitioning from jQuery to leveraging modern technologies like TypeScript and Vue. This shift not only improved the site‚Äôs infrastructure but also expanded its feature set, enhancing user experience.
